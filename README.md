A Path of Exile helper which currently provides the following shortcuts:
- `alt + D` price information from poe.ninja
- `alt  + F` show results from `pathofexile.com/trade` (yet to be styled)
- `alt  + G` open browser with `pathofexile.com/trade`
- `alt + A` map information (boss, pantheon, mod warnings)
- `alt + W` browse wiki for item
- `ctrl + scroll` scroll through stashes anywhere on the screen
- `F5` go to hideout
- Switch between leagues through the system tray icon

:construction: Still a work in progress.

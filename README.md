A Path of Exile helper which currently provides the following shortcuts:

- `alt + Q` open browser with `pathofexile.com/trade`
- `alt + A` map information (boss, pantheon, mod warnings)
- `alt + W` browse wiki for item
- `ctrl + scroll` scroll through stashes anywhere on the screen
- `F5` go to hideout

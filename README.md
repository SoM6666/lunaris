- `alt + W` browse wiki for item
- `ctrl + scroll` scroll through stashes anywhere on the screen
- `F5` go to hideout
- Switch between leagues through the system tray icon

:construction: Still a work in progress, contributions are welcome!

## FAQ

##### Pressing F5 only opens the chat

This has been fixed in v0.3.5

##### I have a moon in my system tray but no shortcut keys work

You are most likely running Path of Exile as administrator. Please exit lunaris and start the .bat file as administrator.

##### Some items give no results

The filters are currently not very 'smart', as they just one-to-one copy the item and paste that into pathofexile.com.
Let us know what we can do to improve your experience.

##### Some items outright don't work

Not all items are currently supported. There are more items supported than not though. Let us know which ones we are missing.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Fractured, Delve, Monster, **Pseudo**, Enchant and Veiled affixes for `pathofexile.com/trade` search
- [ ] Add item type filter for `pathofexile.com/trade` search
- [X] Add Linux support
- [ ] Add language support

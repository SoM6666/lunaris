## Boss screenshots
Are we missing a boss? You can help by making a screenshot of the boss in the maps youâ€™re already running anyway, and filling it out in this form: https://forms.gle/tE9e6PshZ1QWutV48  
We will make sure to credit everyone that has submitted a screenshot somewhere in the tool! Thanks in advance!
